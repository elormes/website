# About Me
Hi. I'm Elorm and someday I'll be a good software engineer.

I created this site to journal my journey to becoming that.

I would also be keeping a running log of sites and books I find useful, both for future reference and for those that come after me.

Feel free to reach out to me via the contact below. You would find that I am able to interact with humans normally :)
